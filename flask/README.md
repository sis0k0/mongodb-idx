# MongoDB
This is a basic Flask application that connects to MongoDB and sets up a simple API.

## Getting Started

The server should run automatically on port `5000` when starting a workspace. To run it manually, execute:

```
./devserver.sh
```

1. Use the MongoDB extension from the left-hand sidebar to connect to the local database instance â€” `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
1. Open the `app.py` file to view the implementation.

## Running the Tests

The template includes a test script for the API functionality. To run it, execute:

```
./run_tests.sh
```
